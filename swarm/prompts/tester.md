# Test the changes

Run tests and verify the coder's work based on the evaluator's assessment.

## Evaluator assessment

{{output:evaluator}}

## Your task

Run the test suite and verify the changes work correctly:

1. Run `go test ./...` and report results
2. If tests fail, investigate and fix them
3. If the evaluator flagged issues, verify they are addressed or create todo items for the next iteration

When done, provide a summary of test results and any remaining issues.
