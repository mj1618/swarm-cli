# Find an improvement or issue

Look through the PLAN.md file and the code base in general and find something to improve.

# Write a feature file

Then plan out the feature and write it to ./swarm/todo/{feature-name}.pending.md

# Exit condition

If you fail to find an improvement, or if you've successfully written a single feature - exit immediately.
