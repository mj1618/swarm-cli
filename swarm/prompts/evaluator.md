# Evaluate coder output

Review the coder's work and provide feedback.

## Coder output

{{output:coder}}

## Your task

Evaluate the code changes made by the coder. Check for:

- Correctness: does the code do what was planned?
- Tests: are there sufficient tests?
- Quality: is the code clean and maintainable?

Provide a summary of what was done well and what needs improvement.
If there are issues, describe them clearly so the coder can fix them in the next iteration.
